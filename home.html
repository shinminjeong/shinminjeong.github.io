      I am a Visual Analytics researcher dedicated to uncovering meaningful patterns within complex data. 
      I earned my PhD from the Australian National University (ANU) with a focus on graph visualization and visual analytics of evolving networks.
      <br/><br/>
      After spending some time in the industry applying data-driven solutions to real-world challenges,
      I have shifted my focus back to research to explore new frontiers in the field.
      Currently, as a Postdoctoral Researcher at ANU, I am designing LLM-based visualization systems and human-centered computing environments.
      I am passionate about bridging the gap between theoretical research and practical application,
      believing that data visualization is the most powerful language for connecting human intuition with technological capability.
      <br/><br/>
      * I am actively involved as the lead engineer in the development of <a href="http://csmetrics.net/">csmetrics.net</a> and <a href="https://influencemap.cmlab.dev/">influencemap.cmlab.dev</a>

            <b>Roslingifier: Semi-Automated Storytelling for Animated Scatterplots</b><br/>
            Roslingifier is a semi-automatic storytelling system based on techniques derived from an analysis of data presentation videos.
            Roslingifier supports quick prototyping of data presentation with auto-detected events and
            enabled storytelling techniques, such as gesture, visual effects, and animation playback.
            Our experimental results indicate that Roslingifier supports users in effectively creating data presentations
            that attract audiences using highlighted events and narratives.

            <b>Visualising Influence in Networks of Time Series</b><br/>
            <a href="https://attentionflow.cmlab.dev/#/overview/basic">AttentionFlow</a> is a system to visualise networks of time series and the dynamic influence they have on one another.
            Centred around an ego node, our system simultaneously presents the time series on each node.
            It supports interactions such as overlaying time series of influence, and filtering neighbours by time or flux.

            <b>Influence Flowers of Academic Entities</b><br/>
            The Influence Flower is a novel data abstraction on an interactive system (<a href="https://influenceflower.cmlab.dev/">InfluenceFlower</a>) which visualises the academic influence through citation network.
            It breakdowns the influence between individuals, organisations and topics, and provides qualitative comparison over time.
            We use academic data for case studies: visualising researchers’ careers over time; the interdisciplinary profile of an institution; and the shifting topical trends in conferences.

            <b>Visualizing Graph Differences from Social Media Streams</b><br/>
            The graph Venn diagram is a new graph layout algorithm to highlight the intersection and differences between the two sub-graphs at different periods of time.
            We construct a graph from the social media stream represented by important people, places, organisations.
            Graph differences are useful for visualising topical shifts, identifying changes in user behaviour or discovering differences in graphs from distinct sources or geography.
